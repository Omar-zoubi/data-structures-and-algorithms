## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O:
time -> O(n)
space -> O(n)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
1.create a function (find_max_value )

2.create a value called maximum :

2.1.create inner fun and check if the root is none :

â€ƒraise an exception

2.2.then give the maximum same of the root .

2.3. compare with the left and right values by sending there values as a parameter for the same function.

3.comparing the left and the right until the end of the tree.
