# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
We created chain of nodes in which each node is connected to each other by means of pointers or references,
our code desigend to create a linked list then add a node as much as we need also we can search over it 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
it is hard when it come to dynamic valuse but I manage to follow some step to do it:
I create a class to creat a node 
Another class to connect them to gather 
Then a method to loop over and search.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I create a class to creat a node 
another class to connect them to gather 
then define a method to loop over and search.
then I test all the function 
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
Linked-List Class is the main class it has 3 main method :
1. insert : It call node class to fill the value of the node and make the node a Head node if the head is none 
2. __str__ : It iterate ove the node and save them in Result value and finally return it 
3. include: itrate over the linked list to looke for spacific value ,, then return a logical value;
