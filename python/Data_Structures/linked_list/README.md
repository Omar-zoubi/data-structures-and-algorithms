# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Understanding the concept of linked list make every thing easyer But it need more fucos to handel every singile detail.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I create three new function first to append 
second to add before targgeted value and the theird was for adding a node after a targgeted value 
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->



# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
After creating a node class and linked list calss to add nodes I added a three new method, Add after, Add before and Append that added more functionality to the code

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
1. Append function: recieve a new value, make it a new node and append it to the linked list.
2. Add before: recieve a new value and another value to add before it , make it a new node search for the (add before value), make the new value reference for next value and make the previouse value refernce for the new value.
3. Add after:  recieve a new value and another value to add aftre it, make the next value pointer for the new value, and the prevouse value well be a refernce fot the new node.
