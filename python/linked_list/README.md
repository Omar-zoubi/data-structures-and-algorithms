# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
We created chain of nodes in which each node is connected to each other by means of pointers or references,
our code desigend to create a linked list then add a node as much as we need also we can search over it 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
it is hard when it come to dynamic valuse but I manage to follow some step to do it:
I create a class to creat a node 
Another class to connect them to gather 
Then a method to loop over and search.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I create a class to creat a node 
another class to connect them to gather 
then define a method to loop over and search.
then I test all the function 
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
First there is a class to create a node then a class to make them on list and referensed to each other and also to loop over them and to look for the needed value
